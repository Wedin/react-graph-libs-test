Response from Bartek and Tomasz:
For simple graphs - Nivo is a good choice.

If you know that you need custom functionality, I will recommend you to do research with Nivo before you decide to use it
They have struggled with custom functionality but were abled to achieve them.
In my opinion, nivo is ok for simple charts, for more advanced - it requires a bit more coding and combinations
